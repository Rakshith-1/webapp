# Angular Ecommerce Web App

This tree tier web application is created using Nodejs, Angular and MySQL. This project also uses Ant Design for its UI and SwiperJS for its carousels. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, Joi for input validation, and JWT for authentication.

We will be using this application to learn and understand the deployment steps of 3-tier web-application on various services of AWS and GCP.. like AWS-EC2, AWS-EKS, AWS-ECS, AWS-beanstalk, GCP-ComputeInstances, GCP-GKS.

## Functionality

The application allows you to browse the home page for products, check out each of the details of the product and add them to your cart for a later checkout.

Adding products to your cart will make a notification pop up and indicate that the product was added successfully.

You are able to see a preview of the cart on the top bar or even navigate into a more detailed cart page.

The checkout process is a multi-page form that at the end allows you to place an order that will later be shown on the order history page.
